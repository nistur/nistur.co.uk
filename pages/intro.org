This is my personal site. It will be in addition to my [[https://philippgeyer.co.uk][more
professional site]]. This site will document my various personal
projects, and personal ponderings on software development in general,
and game development specifically.

I am a game developer. I started wanting to be a game developer as a
child, having found QBASIC on my PC, and writing text adventures. That
does not mean that all I do is strictly games stuff though. I tinker
with a lot of different ideas. I often find topics that I find
interesting and then explore them by writing code. Sometimes these
projects have potential games applications, sometimes they do not.

I will predominantly write most of my experiments in C. This isn't for
some ingrained love of the language, but rather because I tend to
work professionally in higher level code, so C remains familiar, yet
different. I do also experiment with other languages, most notably
assembler and lisp.
